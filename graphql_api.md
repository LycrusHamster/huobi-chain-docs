# Muta GraphQL API


>[GraphQL](https://graphql.org) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API,
gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more,
makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

Huobi-chain has embeded a [Graph*i*QL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) for checking and calling API. Started a the Huobi-chain
node, and then try open http://127.0.0.1:8000/graphiql in the browser.
